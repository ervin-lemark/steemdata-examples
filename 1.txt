This article is being published via stemjs. It is a test as basic as it gets.

Will it work?

    '', // author, leave blank for new post
    'steemitdev', // first tag
    document.getElementById('username').value, // username

    document.getElementById('title').value, // Title
    document.getElementById('article').value, // Body of post
    // json metadata (additional tags, app name, etc)
    { tags: ['steemjs', 'landscapephotography', 'javascript', 'teamslovenia'], app: 'teamslovenia/0.0.1', community: 'teamslovenia' },
    function (err, result) {
      if (err)
        alert('Failure! ' + err);
      else
        alert('Success!');
    }
  );

This is another test of posting an article without an established frontend and directly with the help of the official #steemjs library.

I have two goals here:

1. to test hove tags are really working.

1. to check the community and app attributes are working.

<hr>

# tags

Post's tags are, in my view, defined twice in the ```steem.broadcast.comment``` call:

- as a parameter,
- withing json metadata

Which definition takes precedence?

I will send ```steemitdev'``` as a parameter and 
```{ tags: ['steemjs', 'landscapephotography', 'javascript', 'teamslovenia'], app: 'teamslovenia/0.0.1', community: 'teamslovenia' }```
for json metadata.

What will come out? my guess is that **steemitdev** will become a category tag. I am defining five tags in total, one plus four.

<hr>

# app and community

As you can see from json metadata field above I am also declaring the following:
```{ app: 'teamslovenia/0.0.1', community: 'teamslovenia' }```

I'll check with steemd what will come out. I suppose it will be OK and published as I intend it to.

Ps: It was a beautiful weekend spent outside in the snow under a blazing sun. Along with great memories, I managed to take lots of photos. My stock of white and sky blue photographs is full for a long time :)

See for yourself. This is Mount Raduha, part of the Grintavci Alps group in North Central Slovenia. Beautiful, isn't it?
